# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect BeagleBone Black device running Debian with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Step-1-Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   Computer with Git client installed and access to the
    [azure-iot-sdks](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks) GitHub
    public repository.
-   BeagleBone Black device.
-   SSH client on your desktop computer, such as [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/), so you can remotely access the command line on the BeagleBone Black.
-   USB Mini cable.
-   Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi dongle.
-   Download and install [DeviceExplorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/releases/download/2015-11-13/SetupDeviceExplorer.msi).
-   [Set up your IoT hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/doc/setup_iothub.md).
#### Create a device on IoT Hub
-   With your IoT hub configured and running in Azure, follow the instructions in **"Create Device"** section of [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md).
#### Write down device credentials
-   Make note of the Connection String for your device by following the instructions in **"Get device connection string or configuration data"** section of [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md).

# Step 2: Prepare your Device
-   Follow the instructions on the [beagleboard.org](http://beagleboard.org/getting-started) site to set up your BeagleBone Black device and connect it to your computer.
-   Connect your BeagleBone Black to your network using an ethernet cable or by using a WiFi dongle on the device.
-   Follow the instructions on this [wiki](http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:Terminal_Shells) to obtain your device's IP address.
-   Open an SSH terminal program, such as [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/), on your desktop machine and connect to your device using the IP address from the previous step.
-   Connection settings:
    -   Port = 22
    -   Connection Type = SSH
-   When prompted, log in with username **root** (no password by default).

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

<a name="Step-3-1-Load"></a>
## 3.1 Build SDK and sample

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device.

-   Install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C by issuing the following commands from the command line on your board:

        sudo apt-get update

        sudo apt-get install -y curl libcurl4-openssl-dev uuid-dev uuid g++ make cmake git unzip openjdk-7-jre

    ***Note:*** *This setup process requires cmake version 3.0 or higher.* 
    
    *You can verify the current version installed in your environment using the  following command:*

        cmake --version

    *This library also requires gcc version 4.9 or higher. You can verify the current version installed in your environment using the following command:*
    
        gcc --version 

-   Download the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C to the board by issuing the following command on the board::

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks.git

-   Edit the following file using any text editor of your choice:

        azure-iot-sdks/c/serializer/samples/simplesample_amqp/simplesample_amqp.c

-   Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Step-1-Prerequisites) and save the changes.

-   Build the SDK samples using the following command:

        sudo ./azure-iot-sdks/c/build_all/linux/build.sh

## 3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Run the sample by issuing following command:

        ~/cmake/serializer/samples/simplesample_amqp/simplesample_amqp

-   On Windows, refer "Monitor device-to-cloud events" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) to see the data your device is sending.

-   If you are running other OS, please use the JavaScript tool [iot-hub explorer tool] (https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/tree/master/tools/iothub-explorer/doc)

## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   On Windows, refer "Send cloud-to-device messages" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) for instructions on sending messages to device.

-   If you are running other OS, please use the JavaScript tool [iot-hub explorer tool] (https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/tree/master/tools/iothub-explorer/doc)

# Tips

-   If you just want to build the serializer samples, run the following commands:

        cd ~/cmake/serializer/samples
        make -f Makefile all
